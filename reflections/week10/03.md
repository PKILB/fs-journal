## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

- Rows are complete objects whereas columns are specified properties.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

- CREATE TABLE characters(
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    age VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
- Drop table deletes the entire sql table whereas delete from table deletes a specified row.
