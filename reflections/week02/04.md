## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

- The benefits of making a plan before starting to write the code is because it makes the flow and process creation much easier and cleaner. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

- For me personally I have to sit and look at the code for awhile to see my mistakes or talk to someone about what's going wrong and usually I can figure it out.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

- My biggest takeaway from the article was that if you have messy code, don't just throw more code in and hope that it works, cleanup your "room" before it gets even worse.
