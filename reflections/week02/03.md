## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

- Going into the console tab on your webpage is one way to write information there. You can also printy to the console using print statements from within your project itself.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

- The elements tab.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

- I'm not sure if this is correct but I think that using the sources tab is better.
