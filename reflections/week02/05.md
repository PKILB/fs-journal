# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- We got a lot of really good references this week that helped me out a lot with getting a better grasp on the basics of javascript.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- A surprise for me was that I knew javascript was going to be hard but I didn't know it was going to be this hard.

- What are you struggling with?

- My biggest struggle currently is knowing what to name certain functions or variables in javascript to make everything flow better.

- What would you count as a victory?

- Passing this weeks checkpoint and making it to next week.
