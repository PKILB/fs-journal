## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

- function name(parameters) {                 
}

let name = function(parameters){

}

let name = (parameters) => {

}

- In the first example the function definition is hoisted.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

- The difference between parameters and arguments is that parameters are used when defining a function, and they are the names created in the function definition. Wheres as arguments are the values themselves the function receives from each parameter when the function is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

- Higher order functions are functions that accept another function as a parameter. Array.protype.filter would be an example of one.
