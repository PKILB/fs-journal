## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

- It serves as publishing your skills to a broader audience of people who might have similar needs.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

- It's effective by showing off your skills to the public to prove you know how to code well, and it can also show your expertise on a subject.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

- I think that the capstone project we are working on right now will be a really good project to add, but a project that I would show off a little bit was our last checkpoint as I have improved a lot of my skills.
