## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

- Communication on any sized team is important, especially when coding. This is because coding with multiple people at a time can get really messy and with a lack of communcation no work will be able to get done.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

- By expanding the scope of communications we could reduce the number of meetings but still ensure that key stakeholders stayed informed of the project's progress. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

- The triangle is that "Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap won't be Good".
