## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit testing, component testing and end to end testing. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- As of right now I really like unit testing because of the fact that I can test individual tests of code in isolation. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- As of right now I'm not the biggest fan of end to end testing just because it's a bit more limited.
