## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

- The purpose of wire-framing gives a clear overview of the page structure, layout, user flow etc.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- I believe this is asking about the different types of wire-frames and if so there are three types. Low-fidelity mid-fidelity and high-fidelity and they are each useful in their own way because each of them give a different amount of detail.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- I really believe that wire-frames are worth it because not only are they quick and cheap to make the value they bring to the table is huge. We can perfectly gauge how the user is going to interact with the page through these wire-frames.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

- My take away with the parter cloning activity was that, when you have more than yourself working on a project at a given time, when things go well you can really learn a lot more by seeing how another person would solve a certain situation that I may have never thought of before.
