## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

- A pseudo class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state. I think that one of the most common pseudo classes that I will run into would be the :link.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

-  Specificity is used to determine which css rule should be applied in the chance that multiple rules are targeting both the same element and property of that element.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

- I think that this feature would be breaking that normal flow of the css rules and therefore breaking the code as a whole if used too much.
