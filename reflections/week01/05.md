# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- I learned that people were not joking about how much me would be learning on a week to week basis.

- What are you struggling with?

- I would say that my biggest struggle was vanilla css, but bootstrap is a god send.
