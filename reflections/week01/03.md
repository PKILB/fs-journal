## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

- So far I think my favorite tip would be to add color and weight to create a hierarchy instead of size difference especially since this is a very simple technique to making a website look better overall.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- I'm not quite sure what this question is asking for, but I think that it's asking for a couple examples of well designed sites and if thats the case, the gaming company blizzard has very well designed/layed out content.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- I think that having an overall good design on your website will keep people on your site for a longer period of time and will in the long-term increase the foot-traffic that your site recieves.
