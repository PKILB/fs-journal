# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- A majority of the time I was enjoying my struggles, there were a few times where I just had to take a step away from the code and do something else to get my mind off of it and relax.
