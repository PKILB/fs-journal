# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

- I finished my project today! I got graded just after lunch after I triple checked all of my functionality to make sure that it was working.
