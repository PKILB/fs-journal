# Sprint Retrospective

![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

- I think this is referring to the hackathon group project, but we really followed the driver and navigator method. We had two people on both the backend and frontend and would swap positions of driving and navigating.

2. What went well this week?

- I'm going to answer this question for this week but I would say that I got a lot done on campus and I was making some good headway on my checkpoint.

3. What would you do differently?

- I would spend more time at home as well working on it without getting distracted and then come in with all of my questions ready to go.

The entire backend and most of the front-end were completed today.
