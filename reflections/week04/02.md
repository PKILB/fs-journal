## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

- The three states of a promise are Pending, Resolved and Rejected.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

- Since we can attach callbacks rather than passing them when handling operations with promises we can resolve the issue.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

- The then() method is called after the promise is resolved and the catch() method is used when the Promise fails.
