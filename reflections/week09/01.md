## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

-   We were using two external apis as well as our own. We used the New York Time's and Google api for our project.

2. What went well so far?

-  I really think that our communication has been great so far as a group, especially when it comes down to explaining what we are currently working on, so that way we don't run into any merge conflicts.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

- We all agreed that if we did this all over again we would go into further planning about how we would set up all of our naming conventions in our code to keep it clean.
