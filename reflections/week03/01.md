## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

- The problem that using exports solves is how any code that is referencing a module understands it is a dependency, if the module file is changed or moved the problem is immediately obvious. Modules help remove these naming conflicts.

2. How does export differ from export default?

- Export default just means to export default values which is not needed, you only need to export modules you want to use in other parts of your code.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

- With the module system code can be split into smaller files of self-contained functionality and also multiple scirpts can be concantenated thereby increasing performance.
